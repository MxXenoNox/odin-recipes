## A refresher course on Git

Upon the completion of this project, I should have demonstrated my familiarity with the 
following git commands:

- git clone
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git push

Additionally, I should have developed my muscle memory even further by typing basic HTML tags 
from memory. :muscle: 

Bonus: I'm editing the html files via the CLI! A first for me. At this time of writing, it 
seems to be progressing well. :nail_care:

### Project Conclusion

So I think I'm getting comfortable with the basic git commands. I did struggle a bit in the 
beginning when I did a git push. :sweat: Basically, both local and remote repos weren't in 
sync. I 
found a solution on Stack Overflow: 

	`git push -f origin main`

It was smooth sailing after that! :ship:

I also familiarised myself with writing a basic HTML boilerplate. Thanks, The Odin Project! 
:heart_eyes: :heart_eyes:

It got pretty repetitive quick, but that's what copy and paste is for. :wink: 

This was also a good opportunity for me to use h1, h2, and h3 semantically. 

In all, a fairly solid start today. Go me! :muscle: :boom:

**A quick note: I made sure to link each recipe back to the original version on BudgetBytes. 
Just in case!** :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile:
