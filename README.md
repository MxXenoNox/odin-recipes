# Odin Recipes

## A refresher course on Git

Upon the completion of this project, I should have demonstrated my familiarity with the 
following git commands:

	* git clone
	* git status
	* git add
	* git commit
	* git push

Additionally, I should have developed my muscle memory even further by typing basic HTML tags 
from memory. 

Bonus: I'm editing the html files via the CLI! A first for me. At this time of writing, it 
seems to be progressing well.

### Project Conclusion

So I think I'm getting comfortable with the basic git commands. I also familiarised myself 
with writing a basic HTML boilerplate. Thanks, The Odin Project! 

It got pretty repetitive quick, but that's what copy and paste is for. ;) 

This was also a good opportunity for me to use h1, h2, and h3 semantically. 

In all, a fairly solid start today. Go me!  

**A quick note: I made sure to link each recipe back to the original version on BudgetBytes. 
Just in case!**
