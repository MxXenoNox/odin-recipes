# Odin Recipes
## A refresher course on Git

Upon the completion of this project, I should have demonstrated my familiarity with the 
following git commands:

	* git clone
	* git status
	* git add
	* git commit
	* git push

Additionally, I should have developed my muscle memory even further by typing basic HTML tags 
from memory. 

Bonus: I'm editing the html files via the CLI! A first for me. At this time of writing, it 
seems to be progressing well.
