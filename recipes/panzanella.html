		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>A Tuscan salad borrowed from <a 
href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/panzanella/">BudgetBytes</a>, consisting of day-old bread, 
some vegetables, and summer fruit.</p>
		<p>The perfect salad for using up what you have before they go to waste!</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>3 cups stale bread, cubed</li>
		<li>1/4 c. olive oil, divided</li>
		<li>1 pt. cherry tomatoes</li>
		<li>1 nectarine</li>
		<li>1 cucumber, seeded</li>
		<li>1/2 red onion</li>
		<li>10 oz. baby spring mix</li>
		<li>4 oz. mozzarella pearls</li>
		<li>1 t. kosher salt</li>
		<li>1 T. red wine vingear</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a sheet pan with 
parchment paper. Slice the bread into 2 x 2-in. cubes and place in the sheet pan. Drizzle 
with 1 T. of olive oil and toss to combine. Bake until toasted, about 20 min.</li>
		<li>In the meantime, wash all of the produce. Halve the cherry tomatoes. 
Cut the cucumber length-wise then seed both, then halve both and slice into rounds. Slice 
the nectarine into 1/2" thick slices. Slice the red onion in 1/4" thick half-moons.</li>
		<li>When the bread is golden brown, remove from the oven and let cool.</li>
		<li>Add the toasted bread to a large bowl and top with salad greens, followed 
by the rest of the produce.</li> 
		<li>Add the remaining olive oil, vinegar, and salad to a small container 
with a tight-fitting lid. Close and shake the ingredients until combined. Toss the salad 
in the dressing.</li>
		<li>Let the salad sit in the dressing for at least an hour so the bread 
can absorb the dressing's flavour. Enjoy!</li>
